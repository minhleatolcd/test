'''

CDE already contains a fairly large number of standard and generic properties. By making use of several standard properties, SVG Component provides fundamental functions of a basic CDE component. Note that although the input and storage modes of each property are constrained by its associated input and output types, the logic behind it might be different from one component to another, for its behaviors are freely defined inside the JS files of the components.

In a general context, you usually have an SVG file with predefined width and height values. So, when you incorporate this SVG image into a dashboard using SVG Component, its dimensions are not always appropriate. If so, you can use the “*Ratio*” property to adjust the 2 dimensions all at the same time, given that the proportion between them must be preserved.

The default value of this property is *100* (%). You can choose a value greater than 100 to enlarge the SVG image, or a value greater than 0 and less than 100 to reduce it. If you enter 0 or a negative number, the SVG image will not be displayed.

NOTE: Even if you remove the default value 100 and let this property undefined, its value will be considered as 100.

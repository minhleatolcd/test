Another great feature of SVG Component is the dynamic selectors. With the 5 dynamic selectors available (to be more precise, 4 selectors and 1 checkbox), you can change the statistical method, the number of classes, the color theme, the color inversion or even the key performance indicator (KPI), and directly see the corresponding impact on your SVG graphic.

NOTE: Since this feature should give users a quick visualization of effects generated by different types of modification, there should not be any manual entry options in the selectors. Therefore, the “*User defined classification*” and “*Unique values*” options of the statistical method selector, and the “*Manual*” option of the color theme selector are disabled, while always visible. +
Also, in order to preserve the coherence between these selectors, some selectors need to be hidden from time to time. For example, if the color theme is initially set at “*Manual*”, or the statistical method at “*User defined classification*” or “*Unique values*”, the number of classes selector will be hidden.

The KPI selector is a little more special than the others. A key performance indicator is a measure / value on which the classification and colorization processes are based. Thus, changing a KPI means changing the component datasource. +
First of all, you should create several datasources (queries) for only one SVG Component, each one differing from others on just one value, which is the 2nd column of the data resultset. +
Then, you can fill the “*indicatorMapping*” property with these datasources, to control the indicators available to select. It is a two-column array, the value in the first column being the label for the corresponding datasource name in the second column. This way, you can easily limit selectable datasources and give them custom indicator names.

IMPORTANT: When the dynamic selectors are used, different selections produce their effects on the SVG image and the legend, but the legend information and the component datasource are not changed inside their related properties. Thus, initial choices made by developers are kept intact.

TIP: If you want to display all dynamic selectors except the KPI selector (because it can produce great impact on the SVG graphic), just left the “*indicatorMapping*” property untouched and undefined.

By default, the dynamic selectors are not displayed, as the default value of “*dynamicSelectorsEnabled*” is at “*False*”, for this feature is a highly advanced one.

With several different datasources and a unique shared SVG content, this feature avoids the creation of too many SVG Components and thus improve dashboard overall performance.

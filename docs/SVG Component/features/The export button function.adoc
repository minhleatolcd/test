The last notable feature is the export feature. It allows you to export the whole SVG image and all graphical elements currently contained within. Therefore, you can produce a unique PNG image containing at the same time the SVG image, the colorization, the default color of the entities, the color filtering and zooming effects.

Again, in order not to overload SVG Component with too many features right from the start, the “*exportButtonEnabled*” property is at “*False*” by default, thus the export button will not be displayed if you do not wish so.

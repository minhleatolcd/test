As you probably know, the number of property output types is quite small, whereas a considerable number of property input types already exist, and developers are free to conceive new input types. Therefore, we have developed 3 new input types for the 3 properties that require non-existent input modes: *SvgFile*, *Legend* and *IndicatorMappingArray* (marked in bold red in the above table).

NOTE: The majority of these signature properties do not need a specific default value. Nevertheless, we set the “*Ratio*” property at *100* by default, in order to bring clarity to users. Also, the properties “*dynamicSelectorsEnabled*”, “*zoomEnabled*” and “*exportButtonEnabled*” are set at “*False*” by default, so that the corresponding features will not be activated without user intention and willingness, and that SVG Component presents only its core features in a general context.

There are some important notes regarding the update of SVG Component, as well as any other CDE component:

* *Property name changed:* when a property has its name changed, if an instance of SVG Component was created before the update, it will contain both the old property with its old name and the new property with the new name. The old name will be prefixed by the character “?”, informing that the old property becomes undefined. When the dashboard is saved, CDE will immediately suggest deleting all undefined properties. In this case, you only need to reenter the value for the changed property.
* *Input type name changed:* when an input type has its name changed, if an instance of SVG Component was created before the update, the entered value stored in the related property will not be erased, and the dashboard will be displayed normally. The only problem is that you can no longer modify the value of this property, its corresponding line will be totally disabled, all related input elements will not be correctly displayed. In this case, recreating a new instance of this component with the new configuration after deleting the old one is recommended. This kind of changes is not likely to happen very often, nonetheless (probably in development stage only).
* *Component name changed:* when a component has its own logical name changed, when CDE loads the XML configuration files, it will consider that there is a new type of component (having the new name), and it will not find any configuration that matches the old name. So, all instances of the same component created before the update with the old name will have their properties part completely erased. Likewise, it is recommended to recreate the corrupted instances with the new configuration. Again, this kind of changes is not likely to happen (probably in development stage only).

*SVG Component* was one of the first CDE components created by *Atol CD*. Its main purpose is to provide an easy way to include *SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) image* to CDE dashboards and to apply dynamic information on it in order to create easily memorable visual graphics. It was first developed to create interactive geographical maps, but now it can be used for all types of graphics (metro map, hemicycle group division, etc.), as long as they are SVG images.

== Former solution

Prior to the creation of SVG Component, there was a rather complex way to generate components with similar behaviors to the currently existing SVG Component. We would have to paste the raw XML content of an SVG file into an *Html element* in CDE Layout Panel, then create a *Query Component* to load data from data sources, make use of its *postFetch* function and write some custom JavaScript code modifying the SVG content whenever this component is updated.

This work takes normally a whopping 5 hours for an experienced developer, yet it is not generic nor reusable. A major inconvenience of this method consists in the absence of the *Parameter* property, thus developers would have to write custom JavaScript code inside components’ lifecycle functions or as a resource in Layout Panel, so that other components could listen to changes coming from this component. Another inconvenience is that each graphic’s legend and the colorization would have to be written manually, while this process could very well be automatized with a generic code.

While this solution remains flexible and highly customizable, it should be replaced by a more general solution to enhance work performance, hence the development of *SVG Component*.

== SVG standard

We decided to create a specific CDE component for SVG contents, as the *SVG standard* provides numerous advantages for our cartographic dashboards:

[*] Free, open, standardized, human and machine readable format for vector graphics.
[*] Easy to create using *Inkscape* or any text editor.
[*] Supported by all major web browsers.
[*] Shapes are well preserved while scaling vector images.
[*] Interactive and animated behaviors are defined and can be manipulated.

== Cartographic knowledge

Considering that the SVG Component is intended for interactive maps and graphics, using this component involves possessing some fundamental cartographic knowledge.

The SVG Component is very useful and fitting when it comes to *thematic and chorematic / schematic maps*. These maps usually involve territories, distribution, division, phenomena. This component will help pointing out similarities and differences between entities of a map or graphic, thus make it easier to understand and memorize those characteristics. Since SVG graphics will be colorized, their main entities usually are areal objects.

In graphics generated by SVG Component, some conventional features of a map (scale, directions, etc.) will not be included, since they are already predefined, also they do not help completing the goals of this component. Therefore, users should only focus on determining perception and representation rules permitting the best and easiest understanding of their graphics.

The main elements of a graphic generated by SVG Component are:

* *Title:* informs the focused theme(s) and information of the graphic.
* *Graphic:* contains various data visually represented by the *colorization* and the *tooltip*.
* *Legend:* explains the colors used on the graphic.

In general, these 3 elements will be displayed vertically in the exact same order as above, for it is the natural order of almost all maps and graphics.

A visual graphic usually includes its information sources, but the SVG Component will not handle this element, either because it can be hard-coded along with the SVG content, or it can be easily included in dashboards near the SVG graphic, using a Text Component for example.

The values represented by the colorization of the graphic might be *numeric* (quantitative) or *nominal* (qualitative). They might be raw data directly extracted from data sources, or data processed using a certain statistical method, such as K-means, quantiles, standard deviation, etc.

*Data analysis* can be separated into 2 types: *formula-based calculation* and *statistical analysis*. The former should be done beforehand, directly inside the related query for example, for each data record; while the latter will be done later, when the data arrive and form a series, on which statistical methods can be applied and data will be classified into legend groups.

The SVG Component incorporates several extra features, which will be described in a <<Original%20features{outfilesuffix}#,dedicated section>>.
